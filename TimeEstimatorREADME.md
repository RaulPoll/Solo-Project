# Project 1: Time Estimator
## As the name states, the Time Estimator program acquires an amount of events from user
## as well as the estimated time for each event, hence the name. 

### Possible future updates: 
1. Adding up the estimated time of all events and displaying in days, hrs, and minutes format
2. Adding a menu-type interface 
3. Adding ascii-art
4. Simplify the code
5. Make a C++ version of the TimeEstimator.py
6. Make stadistics of the estimated time totals
